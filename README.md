# TagPrediction-AutoTaggingPhotographers
The Photography Tag Prediction Model is a multi-label classification system designed to automatically assign relevant descriptive tags (e.g., candid, fashion, fine-art) to photographersâ€™ portfolios based on their text descriptions. This enables intelligent tagging, improves searchability, and enhances content categorization on the platform.
